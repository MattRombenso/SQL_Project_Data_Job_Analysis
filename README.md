Dataset from lukebarousse.com/sql

### The questions answered through SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying jobs for a Data Analyst?
2. What are the main skills required for a Data Analyst?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for a Data Analyst?
4. What are the top skills based on salary?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn as a Data Analyst?

# Tools I Used
For this deep dive into the data analyst job market, I leveraged a set of key tools to extract and analyze insights.

- **SQL**: Used to query, filter, and analyze structured data to extract actionable insights.

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used to store, manage, and efficiently query large datasets.

- **VS Code**: Code editor used for writing, testing, and managing SQL and analysis scripts.

- **Git & GitHub**: Version control system and platform used to host the repository, document the project, and ensuring collaboration.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:

## 1. Top Paying Jobs for Data Analyst
 To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary (removing Null Values) and location (comparing on-site and remote jobs). Highlighting the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim
    ON
    company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
### Key observations
- **Wide Salary Range:**
Compensation varies dramatically, from ~$255k to $650k, highlighting how job title, specialization, and seniority heavily influence pay rather than simply being a “Data Analyst.”

- **Strong Presence of Senior & Leadership Roles:**
Many of the highest-paying positions are not traditional analyst roles but include titles like Head of Data Analytics, Director of Analytics, and Research Scientist, indicating that salary growth aligns with strategic and technical responsibility.

- **Specialization Drives Compensation:** Higher-paying roles tend to involve Infrastructure / Data Systems, Advanced Analytics, Strategic Decision-Making and Research & Modeling.

## 2. Main skills for a Data Analyst
To understand what are the skills for the top-paying jobs, i joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value the most.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim
        ON
        company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere'
        AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 50
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim
    ON
    top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim
    ON
    skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### Key observations

- SQL and Phyton are non=negotiable skills for both remote and on-site roles
- Tableau and R are very important skills to have
- Excel and SAS knowledge can be a differential

## 4. Skills based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which are the highest paying.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim
    ON
    job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim
    ON
    skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND 
    job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
### Key observations
- **Top-paying “Data Analyst” roles skew toward engineering & ML Skills:** Skills like PySpark, Databricks, Airflow, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms dominate the highest salaries, showing that the best-paid analysts build and scale data systems, not just dashboards.

- **Big data + cloud expertise is the main salary driver:** Distributed computing (Spark, Hadoop), modern warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery), and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) consistently push roles into higher pay bands.

- **Classic analyst tools are table stakes, not differentiators:** Python, R, BI tools, and SQL cap around ~$100k; salary jumps come from automation, MLOps exposure, and production-level tooling (Git, CI/CD, Linux).
